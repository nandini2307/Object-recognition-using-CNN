Efficient and accurate object detection has been an important topic in the advancement
of computer vision systems. With the advent of deep learning techniques, the accuracy for
object detection has increased drastically. The project aims to incorporate state-of-the-art
technique for object detection with the goal of achieving high accuracy with a real-time
performance. A major challenge in many of the object detection systems is the dependency on
other computer vision techniques for helping the deep learning-based approach, which leads to
slow and non-optimal performance. In this project, we use a completely deep learning-based
approach to solve the problem of object detection in an end-to-end fashion. The network is
trained on the most challenging publicly available dataset (CALTECH 101), on which an object
detection challenge is conducted annually. The resulting system is fast and accurate, thus aiding
those applications which require object detection.
